## Project Summary:
For this project, I wanted to visualize the different types of crimes that appear in Denver. I also created visualizations for resampled crime data for years, months, and quarters of the year.
I used Prophet to forecast this time series data to predict crime rates.

## Findings:
Here is the plot of our predictions. The training data are represented by the black dots, while the forecast is represented by the blue line with upper and lower bounds in the shaded area.
